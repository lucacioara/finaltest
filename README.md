# Things to keep in mind for the development of the course:
- has to be a two-day workshop
  - later, we can expand it

## Introduction
 
The Azure Advanced Architecture Workshop is structured into various modules to provide comprehensive coverage of advanced architectural patterns and practices on Azure. Each module contains theoretical and practical components to help you understand and practically apply the concepts. This repository and workshop will be continuously updated.


## Modules
 
### Module 1: Azure Architecture Introduction
 
**Summary:** This module provides an  overview of Azure's global infrastructure and architectural building blocks. We delve into the complexity of Azure's region pairs, availability zones, and the architectural design principles that ensure high availability, fault tolerance, and disaster recovery.
 
### Module 2: External Communication
 
**Summary:** This module covers options for managing external communication. Learn about API Gateway, API Management, Azure Front Door, and the use of webhooks for integrating with external systems.
 
### Module 3: Scaling Strategies
 
**Summary:** This module explores different scaling strategies for applications and databases. Topics include app service plan scaling, orchestrators, and techniques for scaling databases to meet demand.
 
### Module 4: Caching Strategies
 
**Summary:** In this module, you will learn about various caching strategies to improve the performance and reliability of your applications. Topics include caching patterns, Azure Redis Cache, and Content Delivery Network (CDN).
 
### Module 5: Security Best Practices
 
**Summary:** This module covers advanced security architectures, including Zero Trust, data encryption, and threat protection. Topics include Azure Key Vault, Private Endpoints and Azure Firewall, and using Azure Sentinel for comprehensive threat detection and response.
 
### Module 6: Microservices Architecture
 
**Summary:** Learn about designing, deploying, and managing microservices on Azure. This module covers the use of Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), service mesh technologies, and best practices for microservices architecture.
 
### Module 7: Message Brokers
 
**Summary:** Let's dive into more advanced concepts and use cases associated with Azure Service Bus and Azure Event Grid. This module covers topics such as handling large message volumes, advanced routing, message deduplication, handling message failures, and integrating third-party services
 
### Module 8: Observability and Monitoring
 
**Summary:** This module focuses on observability and monitoring in Azure. Learn about the importance of monitoring, how to set up autoscaling, and diagnosing application performance with Azure Monitor and Application Insights.
